        <h2 id="The-Year-of-2023"><a href="#The-Year-of-2023" class="headerlink" title="The Year of 2023"></a>The Year of 2023</h2><p>It is hard to define 2023 as a terrible extension of the <em>past three years</em>, or a brand-new year after the pandemic, that came with hope and surprise. I wasn’t sure about this from the start of January 1st until the end of December 31st.</p>
<p>During this year, the economy still was a big mess, even worse than the pandemic era, and the recovery seems harder than what people expanded. As for me, a lot of my colleagues lost their jobs this year, and it took them more time to get a new one. The next lay-off is on the way, <strong>am I ready for this?</strong></p>
<p>The endless pandemic has passed, for now, yet the uncertainty is still there and permeates all aspects of life and our surroundings. Is deep pessimism spreading everywhere, or is it just another <em>great year of victory</em> once again?</p>
<p>Shall we let history tell us? After all, we all know what <em>the book</em> will say, don’t we?</p>
<p>Behind the shadow of those protagonists, <strong>these nobodies also have lived</strong> and should be recorded by someone in some way.</p>
<p>I, and perhaps many others, <a href="https://jixiaoyong.github.io/imissyou/posts/2990f05c/#%E6%98%9F%E5%85%89">believed that <strong>the light would eventually shine</strong></a> after enduring all the terrible hardships, especially after those brave, lovely individuals made their stand last year. It’s true. At the point of the end of this year, we can say that things are not as horrible as <em><strong>they</strong></em> affirmed. Yeah, it’s bad at the beginning, but as time changes, <em><strong>it</strong></em>’s getting weaker and weaker. Was it too late to go back to normal life? Was it too late to appease people’s fear and tired? Was it too late to get their trust and confidence back?</p>
<p>The elephant in the room is becoming bigger and bigger every day, is there still some room available for the little ant to stay? What if the hand suddenly hovers over your domain one day? It’s easy to make one unwelcome to discuss these things. It’s not cool, not enjoyable, and sometimes it can even be unsafe. However, as long as we inhabit the same space, it’s hard to ignore the existence of <strong><em>it</em></strong>. Just like the water in which fishes swim, it’s everywhere at any time, and there is no exit.</p>
<h2 id="Life-still-goes-on"><a href="#Life-still-goes-on" class="headerlink" title="Life still goes on"></a>Life still goes on</h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>Things can change suddenly; the only certainty is change.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing we can learn from the <em>past three years</em> is that life is priceless and everyone does have only one chance. So, what kind of life are you going to have? Is there a certain roadmap for everyone to follow?</p>
<p><strong>Feel free to change, to explore, to experience.</strong></p>
<p>Always keep this in mind:“ <strong><em>Never stop exploring</em></strong> ”. You have to experience as much as different kinds of life to find the perfect lifestyle for you. That’s what I learned from life for over two decades. And thank God there still have time to explore, and maybe still <strong>be free to change</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="AI"><a href="#AI" class="headerlink" title="AI"></a>AI</h2><p>The hottest thing must be AI when people look back at this year on the future. I, like other poor guys who are not clever enough, still not sure that will AI make our life better or take over our life in the future, and force us to live like the people in the movie <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong>. But for now, AI does bring some great changes to my life, and make it easier to study and work.</p>
<p>As for me, the first time heard about AI was that people talking about something can draw varied and magic pictures, and then there came the GitHub Copilot which could autocomplete compute programs sentences correctly and productively.</p>
<p>And then, after all of these little dim sum, <strong><em>the big bang</em></strong> jumped up to the center of the stage — the <strong>ChatGPT</strong>. Even though there have been so many AI products such as Google Alpha Go and so on before, ChatGPT as the first well-known AI product has the closest connection with people’s normal life, I mean, you can TALK to it in natural language directly! The communication between humans and machines has changed since then.</p>
<p>It’s still hard to say what kind of change AI can do for our future. It’s still not as perfect as people expected, and also not very reliable, but all of these don’t change the fact that AI may be the most important thing at the beginning of this century.</p>
<p>After the steam and the electricity, we finally see the next super-elevation power of our century.</p>
<p>Luck for me, I still have time to see what will happen.</p>
<h2 id="Trivia"><a href="#Trivia" class="headerlink" title="Trivia"></a>Trivia</h2><p>I made the switch to an Apple-chip computer in February, and it’s been totally worth it. Most of my work can easily run on it, smoothly. I even can’t feel its existence while I am working, everything is so smooth and working as expected, without endless jank or annoying fan noise.</p>
<p>I have tried many awesome macOS applications in the past few years, they help me a lot. There is a short list of some of them, just in case you may be interested in them:</p>

<p>Another thing I tried this year, again and again, is VIM, and there is still a long way to go. Meanwhile, there is one thing worth celebrating: I have persisted in Duolingo for over a year, which has been a challenge for me. As a computer programmer, English is important to me, but it is hard to remember words and grammar for me. Anyway, keep learning every day.</p>
<p>Even though Jetpack Compose has been released for many years, and I have tried it many times, I still haven’t applied it to the company’s business projects until this year. After writing Android and other native platforms <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/jixiaoyong/ApkSigner">applications</a> with Jetpack compose, and thanks to Kotlin—the awesome program language, I enjoy the programming experience. In my opinion, functional programming such as Jetpack Compose and Flutter is what modern mobile development should be!</p>
<p>It’s very lucky for me to have a stable way to access a variety of resources on the internet, it should be one’s birthright, but it is becoming more and more difficult these days. Life is not that easy, many “normal” things are not natural existence and can be changed over time. It’s sad to admit that most of the time we are forced to face the pressures from both sides. What a ridiculous and sad situation. Especially after you once experienced the unwalled era, it’s sad to face the trend of counter-globalization.</p>
<p><strong>Best wishes, to the free network and the world!</strong></p>
<p>After all, life continues, and there is still time.</p>
<p>It’s not until we lose something that we understand its importance. If <em>it</em> didn’t happen, I would never know how deeply I love the fresh air and the view outside the house. Especially after I go through those horrible days when a person can be randomly forced into isolation for some * reason. How many misfortunes <em>come with goodness first</em> until they lose control and get mad? It’s unhelpful to discuss the wish good or bad, once the actions have been done, the only rule to judge is the effect they made. Anyway, I have explored as many places as I can during the year 2023, mother nature seems to have the power to cure one’s soul.</p>
<p>To figure out the difference between these days and the previous days, I did some statistical analysis of my sporting data from Xiaomi Fitness and Amap(Unfortunately, all these applications only count the walking and biking information, other types such as car&#x2F;train&#x2F;bus… doesn’t included). What surprised me was the total size of the origin data is nearly 100Mb (What a crazy company!). This dataset is enormous. Neither <em>WPS</em>, <em>Apple Numbers</em>, nor even <em>Microsoft Excel</em> can handle such a large volume of data: it either crashes upon opening the file, or becomes too sluggish to respond to any operation. Eventually, after some programming, I managed to create a structured version of all this data and have completed some analytical tasks.</p>
<p><del>It’s interesting to note that, despite my perception of spending most weekends out and about, the data indicates that the changes weren’t as significant as I thought.</del> From June 2020 to October 2021, I lived quite a distance from my office, which resulted in an unusually high total distance. Disregarding this period, it can be observed that the distance is increasing year by year. A notable change this year is my shift from walking to cycling, as evidenced by the rapid increase in the percentage of the total distance covered by cycling.</p>

<p>For the chart titled ‘Cycling and Walking Information in 2023 (Monthly)’, it can be observed that after I began cycling in March, the distance covered by cycling increased while the distance covered by walking started to decrease. There was a specific increase during the National Day in October.</p>

<p>The sleep interval was gradually decreasing day by day. This chart reveals a disheartening reality. In 2021, there was a moment when, although I had relocated to a place closer to my office, my sleep duration still experienced a significant decrease. Aside from a variety of other factors, it appears that this shift roughly coincided with the time I transitioned to my current department.</p>

<p>On the other hand, even though it has lost nearly a quarter of the <em>existing things</em>, the total amount has already roughly reached 1M during this year, which was an unpractical milestone once before.</p>
<p>I’ve been silent for a while, ever since my last social network account got ghost-banned. This shall be the first and last time that I have to face a situation like this – I will reduce the time wasted on those platforms. The public social networks run by the companies are not stable anymore for many reasons, and this makes me upset to post my thoughts on these platforms, it’s a good time for me to back to my blog and fully control everything I have without any limit. As for now, GitHub seems still a reliable platform to host my blog and will continue working for a long time. Anyone who wants to stay in touch with me can kindly keep “<a href="mailto:jixiaoyong1995+imissyou@gmail.com?subject=%5BMail%20From%20I%20Miss%20You%5D&charset=UTF-8">jixiaoyong1995@gmail.com</a>” and “<a href="https://jixiaoyong.github.io/">https://jixiaoyong.github.io</a>” in your notebook.</p>
<h2 id="One-more-thing…"><a href="#One-more-thing…" class="headerlink" title="One more thing…"></a>One more thing…</h2><p>The book of this year for me is <strong><em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em></strong>. It’s been a lengthy journey, consuming over a hundred hours to finish all five volumes. Nearly half of my year’s leisure time was invested in immersing myself in the characters’ lives and exploring this magical and joyful world. At times, I can snap the familiar perspectives from <strong><em>The Three-Body</em></strong>, which is a wonderful experience like two guys you admire are already aware of and appreciate each other.</p>
<p>The other thing that must be pointed out is the movie called <strong><em>Journey to the West</em></strong>. I didn’t expect it to be so perfect and up my street. What will happen when <em>Don Quixote</em> lives in our life right now? Hard to say what kind of story this movie is talking about, funny, ridiculous, or an idealist’s epitaph? I don’t know. I enjoyed it, that’s enough.</p>
<p>There still are many other things that I didn’t notice, waiting for an adventure. I still remember some of them’s names, just list them here for whoever is interested in them:</p>
<ul>
<li>《无路可逃》by 冯骥才</li>
<li>《悟空传》by 今何在</li>
<li><strong><em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em></strong> by George Orwell</li>
<li><strong><em>Animal Farm</em></strong> by George Orwell</li>
<li><strong><em>The Hunger Games</em></strong>, movie</li>
<li><strong><em>The Truman Show</em></strong>, movie</li>
